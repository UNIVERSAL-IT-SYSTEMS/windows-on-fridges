## Building the Robot 

## Step 1. Motors
Your Galileo should be plugged in and you should have [HelloBlinky](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/HelloBlinky.htm) working. 
Connect the motor shield to the galileo and attach the 2 motors to the shield.
The motor shield we used is a [SeeedStudio V2 Motor Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Motor-Shield-V20-p-1377.html?cPath=91_92). This shield can either be powered directly from the board or from an external power source via its external power jack. Without external power the motors may not turn when a load is applied.

## Step 2. Robot frame
There are many frames to choose from when it comes to building a small to mid sized robot. [Makeblock](http://www.makeblock.cc/) is a simple open platform for robotics that is easy to put together. Here is an example configuration of a Makeblock robot with a galileo attached. You can get pretty creative here, there is no right way to build an awesome robot.

## Step 3. Putting it all together
Secure all your parts on the robot frame. You will need space for a Galileo, 2 batteries, and a wifi adapter.
