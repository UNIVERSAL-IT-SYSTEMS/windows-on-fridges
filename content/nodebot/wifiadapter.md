## Using a Wifi Gaming Adapter with the Intel Galileo

Wifi gaming adapters allow you to connect devices to wifi that otherwise could 
only connect over LAN.

* Purchase an adapter, such as [this recommended option](http://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-WNCE2001-Universal-Internet-Adapter/dp/B007CO5DZ4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1404169366&sr=8-3&keywords=wireless+gaming+adapter)
* Follow the instructions supplied with your gaming adapter to connect it to your wireless network.
* Connect the Gaming Adapter to the Galileo with an ethernet cable.
* The recommended adapter also includes a USB power cable; If your adapter includes a USB power cable connect it to the Galileo with a [Micro USB Male to USB A Female Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Micro-USB-Male-Female-Adapter/dp/B0027YYMU6) . The Galileo can provide sufficient power to the recommended adapter.
* Connect your development machine to the same wireless network as the gaming adapter.
* Ping the Galileo by hostname and ensure it is connected to the network.
* You should now be able to deploy to the Galileo over wireless network!
