## Some ideas to build on this project:

* Create a bigger robot with a big base (e.g. electric wheel-chair base) and an actual mini-frige on top
* Create the fridge that restocks itself
* Attach a barcode scanner to the fridge to keep track of drinks available and inform user through the web-app
* Make the robot to study the space and make a map itself
* Make a convenient tool to draw maps and generate a simple SVG code.
* Attach Cortana to the robot to enable voice communication
* Use Kinect for obstacle detection
* Use wheel encoders for more precise distance recognition
